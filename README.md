# HACKERRANK
In This Respository, You can download all Solutions that has been asked on HackerRank [ https://www.hackerrank.com ] cause HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.
I Solve Probelms on HackerRank because it gives me a better practice to solve other complicated programs anywhere. HackerRank is about for For 

Fun - What's more exciting than solving challenging problems? We're constantly adding helpful features to make our platform the best possible experience, such as boilerplate code and animations that display when you're running code.

Jobs - Looking for a job at an awesome company? You can get hired by solving challenges! See our Jobs page for details.

Glory - As you solve more challenges, you earn points and move up the HackerRank Leaderboard.

Community - We're constantly growing our strong community of developers who discuss problems, learn, compete, and collaborate together.

Learning - Expand your knowledge by learning new programming topics and techniques by going through our challenges and editorial solutions. We believe the best way to learn something is by doing it! Have a look at our Tutorial domains.

CHALLENGE DETAILS

Which Computer Science domains do your challenges cover?

Our challenges cover a wide range of domains such as:

    Algorithms
    Artificial Intelligence: Write an AI bot to play a 1-player game, or play against other AI bots!
    Distributed Systems
    Databases
    Mathematics
    Cryptography and Security
    Language Specific Domains: Test your coding chops with Java, C++, Ruby, Python, Linux shell, SQL, a variety of functional languages.

Don't see what you're looking for? We're adding new domains all the time!

HOW DOES SCORING WORKS ?

Check out our Scoring Documentation for a comprehensive overview of how we score different types of challenges and determine leaderboard positions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I WRITE MY CODES ?

Each challenge page has an online editor embedded in the page for you to write and test your code in. If you're more comfortable coding in your favorite IDE, you can always upload your code to the challenge page when you're done!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I TEST OR SUBMIT MY CODES ?

When you finish the first version of your code, click Run Code button to run your solution against one or more small sample test cases. Once you're confident your solution covers the entire problem, click Submit to run it against the entire set of test cases (or bots) and get a score for the challenge. Don't worry if you don't pass all the test cases, you can always rework your code and submit it again for an updated score. The score that shows up on the leaderboard will be the one for your top-scoring submission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I DEBUG MY CODE ?

You can debug on your computer using any tool that you like. When coding in our online editor, anything printed to STDOUT will be matched against the challenge's Expected Output (so printing debug statements there could cause you to fail the challenge). If your submission language supports printing to STDERR (e.g., cerr for C++, System.err.println for Java, console.error for JavaScript, etc.), you can send your debug output there and it will show up in a separate Error box underneath the challenge's Expected Output.

Can my code write to a file?

Check out the Writing State Information to a File tab on our Environment page.

What happens after I submit my code?

We run your code against hidden test cases. Depending on the output your code produced, you can get the following verdicts:

    Accepted. Congratulations, your code passed all the test cases! It's time to solve a new challenge!
    Wrong Answer. The output your code produced didn't match the output expected by the test case. Rethink your approach and think about whether you misunderstood the problem or missed a corner case.
    Terminated due to timeout. Your code doesn't solve the problem efficiently enough! If you write a O(2n) solution when n = 100, it will surely time out and you're going to need to optimize your algorithm. The time limits are different for each language (some languages are slower than others), and you can see the limits for all the languages we support at our Environment page.
    Runtime error/Segmentation Fault. Your code terminated unexpectedly. Did you overrun your array? Is your code trying to divide by zero?
    Abort Called. Are you using too many resources? Maybe an array you created is too large and exceeds the memory limit, or an assert statement in your code is failing.

After you submit your code, hover your mouse cursor over the icon for each test case to view the verdicts and runtime for each test case your code was tested against.

Are there any shortcut keys?

There are limited shortcut keys (hotkeys) which are currently supported in challenge solving page:

    alt/option + R : Run code
    alt/option + Enter : Submit code
    alt/option + F : Enable full screen
    Esc : Restore full screen

CONTEST DETAILS 

What types of contests do you host?

    101-Hack. In this monthly algorithmic contest, you have two hours to solve five challenges. The top-10 winners get a HackerRank t-shirt.
    HourRank. This is our shortest contest â€” you have one hour to solve three or four algorithm challenges. The top-10 winners get a HackerRank t-shirt.
    Week of Code. A weeklong algorithm contest where one new challenge is released each day. Things get harder as the week progresses, and the challenges are run against additional test cases at the end of each day. You can submit (or resubmit) solutions for prior days' challenges throughout the week, but there's a small point penalty for submitting solutions for challenges released on previous days. The top-10 winners get a HackerRank t-shirt.
    Ad Infinitum. We host this 48-hour Mathematics contest every three months. The top-10 winners get a HackerRank t-shirt.
    Real Data/Machine Learning contests. This weeklong contest focuses on real-world data skills and requires the use of machine learning techniques.
    Language/Domain Specific Contests. We periodically hold competitions that focus on a specific language (e.g., C, Java, Python, etc.) or domain (e.g., AI, machine learning, databases, etc).
    Company Contests. We regularly hold competitions sponsored by specific companies looking to hire engineers. These contests vary in duration, rules, or challenge type/topic, depending on what the sponsor is looking to test for. After the contest, the sponsoring companies contact top performers on the leaderboard about job opportunities (so be sure to opt-in).
    World CodeSprint. A 24-hour contest with 7-8 challenges. These contests are sponsored by multiple companies and have some seriously worthwhile prizes for the winners!
